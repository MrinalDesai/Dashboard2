         costs and time, cutting warehousing costs, reducing vehicular pollution and congestion, improving 
         the tracking and traceability of consignments through infrastructural, procedural, and information technology interventions.

         \nSince, in 2017, India had comparatively high logistics costs, 13% of total price of goods compared with 8% in other 
      major economies and average 72% higher cost than China of exporting/importing a container in India.To make India globally 
      competitive by reducing these costs and time, the MoRTH is developing multi-modal logistics parks at selected locations in 
      the country under its Logistics Efficiency Enhancement Program (LEEP).""")
