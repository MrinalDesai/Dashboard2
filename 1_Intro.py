st.write("""According to NHD The vast majority of Indians still own two-wheelers ‚Äî as many as 55 per cent of 
         Indian households have a bicycle,while those with scooters and motorcycles come a close second at 54 
         per cent, according to the survey.
         
         \nThe findings of the NFHS-5, conducted among 6,64,972 families, or households, were released earlier this month. 
         It was carried out by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.Around 3.7 per cent of the country‚Äôs families 
         were found to own animal-driven carts, while about 20 per cent did not own any mode of transport.
         
         
         \nThe NFHS-5 data also revealed a regional disparity in the number of households owning cars.
         While low incomes are often linked with the absence of car ownership, experts say having a car 
         should not be viewed as a sign of prosperity. Road infrastructure, they added, should also take 
         into consideration the needs of cyclists, who help the environment by reducing emissions.""")

st.write("""Before the 1990s, owning a car was a herculean task in India. Loans were fewer, and automobile brands limited.

         \nDespite the comparative ease of getting a car in light of the economic reforms introduced in the 1990s, 
        the increase in the number of car owners in the country has been slow.The first NFHS, conducted in 1992-93, 
        revealed that barely 1 per cent of families owned cars. Motorcycles and scooters, meanwhile, were owned 
        by 8 per cent of families, with 42 per cent of the surveyed households owing bicycles.
        
          \nBy 1998-99, when the second round of the NFHS was conducted, about 1.6 per cent of families owned cars. 
         Nearly 47.8 per cent owned bicycles.
         
         
         \nBy 2005-06, the number went up to 56.5 per cent for bicycle owners and 2.8 per cent for car owners. 
         Since then, the percentage of families owning a bicycle has remained around 55 per cent, but the number 
         of families owning a car has jumped to 8 per cent.


         \nThe number of car-owning families is higher in cities ‚Äî around 14 per cent of families surveyed in urban India 
         (for NFHS-5) own cars, against 4 per cent in rural India.That the penetration of cars in India is lower than 
         in many developed countries has been admitted by Niti Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant. In 2018, Kant said 22 people 
         per-thousand population owned cars in India, as compared to over 500 in Japan, Canada and the UK.
         Lower per capita income of Indians has been cited as one reason for this. The average annual income of an Indian 
         is less than 2000 dollars , according to World Bank data, while the minimum cost of a car ‚Äî a hatchback like a 
         Maruti Alto, for example ‚Äî is about 5000-6000 dollars.""")
